Let's write a graph representing sub-events that occur in a person's life based on a short summary of their personality. Nodes represent sub-events and edges represent the influence of past sub-events on a current sub-event.
- The graph is represented in the form of a json list. 
- Each entry is a dictionary containing the following keys: "sub-event", "time", "caused_by", "id". 
- The "sub-event" field contains a short description of the sub-event. 
- The "time" field contains a date.
- The "id" field contains a unique identifier for the sub-event.
- The "caused_by" field represents edges and is a list of "id" of existing sub-events that have caused this sub-event. Sub-events in the "caused_by" field should occur on dates before the sub-event they have caused. Generate as many causal connections as possible.
- An example of a causal effect is when the sub-event "started a vegetable garden" causes "harvested tomatoes".
- Sub-events should contain visual details such as "bought a red scarf" or "played tennis".
- Sub-events can be good or bad.

For example,

INPUT: Tom is a 36 year old male Computer Scientist, who is dynamic and creative. He is married to Sophia. He likes outside activities like surfing, climbing and hiking. He likes to cook italian dishes, including focaccia and pasta, and he often cook for his friends. He has a good number of friends and some of them are neighbors, like Emma and Jason. He wakes up early in the morning to do some sport activities. His goals and plans are to become a dad since his wife is pregnant, save up to buy a mansion, and buy kitchen gadgets. He likes his neighbor dogs, but he would not have one for himself.

For the given personality, generate four independent events aligned with their personality. Start and end your answer with a square bracket.
INPUT: Brian is a 25 year old male who loves animals and the outdoors. He enjoys visiting farms and petting zoos, and even volunteers at a pet shelter whenever he can. He likes to listen to country music, and he also runs a vegan newsletter. Although he loves both dogs and pigs, he has never been able to keep one himself as a pet, but he does have a fish living in his apartment. He loves to collect different plant-based food recipes, and he often shares delicious vegan options with his family and friends.

INPUT: Brian is a 25 year old male who loves animals and the outdoors. He enjoys visiting farms and petting zoos, and even volunteers at a pet shelter whenever he can. He likes to listen to country music, and he also runs a vegan newsletter. Although he loves both dogs and pigs, he has never been able to keep one himself as a pet, but he does have a fish living in his apartment. He loves to collect different plant-based food recipes, and he often shares delicious vegan options with his family and friends.

OUTPUT: 


Let's write a graph representing sub-events that occur in a person's life based on a short summary of their personality. Nodes represent sub-events and edges represent the influence of past sub-events on a current sub-event.
- The graph is represented in the form of a json list. 
- Each entry is a dictionary containing the following keys: "sub-event", "time", "caused_by", "id". 
- The "sub-event" field contains a short description of the sub-event. 
- The "time" field contains a date.
- The "id" field contains a unique identifier for the sub-event.
- The "caused_by" field represents edges and is a list of "id" of existing sub-events that have caused this sub-event. Sub-events in the "caused_by" field should occur on dates before the sub-event they have caused. Generate as many causal connections as possible.
- An example of a causal effect is when the sub-event "started a vegetable garden" causes "harvested tomatoes".
- Sub-events should contain visual details such as "bought a red scarf" or "played tennis".
- Sub-events can be good or bad.

For example,

INPUT: Tom is a 36 year old male Computer Scientist, who is dynamic and creative. He is married to Sophia. He likes outside activities like surfing, climbing and hiking. He likes to cook italian dishes, including focaccia and pasta, and he often cook for his friends. He has a good number of friends and some of them are neighbors, like Emma and Jason. He wakes up early in the morning to do some sport activities. His goals and plans are to become a dad since his wife is pregnant, save up to buy a mansion, and buy kitchen gadgets. He likes his neighbor dogs, but he would not have one for himself.

# Data and Code for the **ACL 2024** Paper "**Evaluating Very Long-Term Conversational Memory of LLM Agents**"

## Data

We release LoCoMo, a high-quality evaluation benchmark consisting of *very* long-term conversational data. The benchmark consists of ten conversations. Each conversation is annotated for the **question-answering** and **event-summarization** tasks. Additionally, the dialogs in each conversation can be used for the **multimodal-dialog-generation** task. See statistics of the dataset in the Table below.

The dataset can be found in the ```data/locomo10.zip``` file in this repository.

Note: This release is a subset of the conversations released previously with our first Arxiv version in March 2024. The initial release contained 50 conversations. We sampled a subset of the data to retain the longest conversations with high-quality annotations and for cost-effective evaluation of closed-source LLMs.
